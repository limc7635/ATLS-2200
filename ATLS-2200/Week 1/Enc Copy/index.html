      <h1>Fun Facts About Bears</h1>
      <p> Did you know that polar bears are the largest bear species in the WHOLE WORLD? Their length can extend to be that of nearly 9 feet and weighing around 1,500 pounds! Polar bears actually have all black skin underneath their two layers of fur; in which their fur is around six inches thick that also reflects light which is why they appear white! When a female polar bear is pregant they will build a den in order to give birth to their cubs for the first chapter of their lives. During this period, however, she doesn't feed her offspring and can go up to eight whole months without any food (which is the longest deprivation period of any animal)! When these polar bears give birth they tend to produce to one to three cubs at a time weighing only around one pound each. With all this being said... the most alarming fact about polar bears is that they are the single most carniverous species of bear, usually feeding on seals but will even hunt for humans.</p>
